# responsive-portfolio

## Description

In this project, I created a responsive website consisting of three pages (index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html) using Bootstrap CSS Framework. Each page has a consistent look and feel and is designed to render well on a variety of devices.

## Functionality

* Each page has a basic Bootstrap nav bar, page header, and responsive layout.
* The index.html includes an image of me, a blurb about me, and sidebar with links to GitHub and LinkedIn.
* The portfolio.html page consists of five images designed to be responsive using Bootstrap CSS.
* The contact.html page contains several input fields and a submit button.
